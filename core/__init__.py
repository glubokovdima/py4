# core/__init__.py

# This file makes the 'core' directory a Python package.

# You can optionally expose commonly used functions or classes from submodules here
# for easier access, e.g.:
# from .helpers.utils import load_config
# from .cli.main import main_cli_entry_point

# For now, let's keep it minimal or re-export a key utility.
# Example of re-exporting the config loader:
# from .helpers.utils import load_config

# If no specific re-exports are needed immediately, this file can remain empty
# or contain just a docstring.
